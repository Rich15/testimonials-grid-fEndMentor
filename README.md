## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

**This is my third Frontend Mentor challenge!**

I started as usual, building the HTML structure. Once finished I continued styling everything. I already knew that I was going to use a Grid layout, I just needed to recap the grid properties (see [Useful resources](#useful-resources)). I was struggling with the height of the items and their content, but using `grid-gap` and `padding` helped me to solve it.   

After finishing the desktop design, I used media queries to style the mobile version. It was very easy, I just changed the grid layout for a Flexbox one (in columns), and adjusted some images; I also added a little shadow to the items.  

This challenge was fun and easy, I really enjoyed practicing my Grid skills, and now I feel more comfortable using it :)

### Continued development

Grid layouts are awesome, so I want to master Grid and Flexbox to make some pretty websites.  

I will probably do some JS next.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This guide was a great resource to review all the Grid properties when I needed.
